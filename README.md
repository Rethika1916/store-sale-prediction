# store-sale-prediction
Overview

This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to enhance store sales forecasting. By analyzing historical sales data alongside factors such as seasonal trends, promotions, and economic indicators, we implement and compare various predictive models.

Features

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Implementation of multiple machine learning models:

Linear Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forests

Performance evaluation using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Comparative analysis of traditional vs. ML-based forecasting methods

Results

Our analysis demonstrates that machine learning significantly improves prediction accuracy. The Random Forest model, in particular, reduces mean absolute error by up to 20% compared to traditional forecasting techniques.

Benefits

Enables retailers to make data-driven decisions

Optimizes inventory management

Enhances operational efficiency
